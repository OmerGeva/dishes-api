# What IP is 172.17 0.1 Docker?
# The bridge connection docker0 – with IP address 172.17. 0.1 – is created by Docker at installation time.
# Because the host and all containers are connected to that network, our application only needs to listen
# to it.  See, for instance, https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/
